The Militia came back in the semi finals to beat MHG and meet the NJ Renegades in 
the U-16 championship game. The boys were down 2-0 in the third period when they scored 
twice to quickly even it up late in the game. The boys had to kill over a minute of a 
5 on 3 with under 2 minutes to go. Once again in overtime the Militia found themselves 
killing another full 5 on 3. Kayser Raei took a chip out of the zone down the wall and threw 
it towards the net to beat the NJ Renegades goalie for the 3-2 championship victory. The 
team was paced by Kayser Raei up front, Ryan Shea on the blue line and Mike Royer in the pipes. 
This is the U-16 Militia's 3rd Championship in one year!
