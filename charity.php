				<p>The Travis Roy Foundation was established in 1997 
				to help spinal cord injury survivors and to fund research 
				into a cure. Inspired by Travis&apos; own story, the lifeblood 
				of the Travis Roy Foundation has been the generosity of 
				individuals, corporations and foundations across North America. 
				This generosity has made an immediate impact on the lives of many 
				individuals.</p>

			<p>Thomas E. Smith is a young man who's love for the game of Hockey is 
				undeniable. After sliding into the boards awkwardly, Thomas was paralyzed. 
				He worked non stop and never felt sorry for himself and after a rigorous 
				rehabilitation program, Thomas was cleared by 5 different doctors and was 
				back on the ice! He had just as much of a risk of paralysis as anybody else 
				on the ice. Coming around the net during practice, Thomas' skate caught an edge 
				and he went into the boards..again and completely unrelated spinal cord injury 
				was pronounced paralyzed for a second time. Thomas accepted it as his mission 
				to raise awareness and help find a way to cure paralysis. Thomas is a great 
				young man who is currently earning his degree at Babson College. Help out a great 
				cause and <a style="color:blue;" href="http://www.justcureparalysis.org/">Donate Now</a>.
