('U-16 Militia Win AAA Spring Fling', 'The 1996/1997 team got on the ice for the first time ever as members of the Militia. They showed great skill in game one outshooting the opponent Team Kanaly 37- 5 but the chemistry and team work was not there and we lost 3-1. The boys started out sluggish in game two going down 3-0 heading into the 3rd period. Coach Tasiopoulos commented on that 3rd period. "From that 3rd period on, the boys finally bought in and realized they can have all the skill in the world, but if they aren''t willing to go to those hard nosed places like the corners and the front of the net then they are not going to be successful. I preached to them that 80% of goals at any level of hockey are scored right in front of the net, and the boys started throwing everything on net and following up shots for 2nd and 3rd chances." The Militia went on to win that game 6-3 and score 6, 6, 7, 6 goals for in their final 4 games of undefeated play. From the net out, the team matured quickly in 5 games and Coach Kanaly said "I have been doing these tournaments for years now and this is one of the best U-16 teams I have ever seen." Congrats to the U-16 Militia. The next 1997 tournament is The NH Championships, June 14th at Salem Icenter.', 'U-16_Champs.png', '2013-08-31 19:53:42'),
('Three members of the Jr. Major East Coast Militia named to Pre Draft All-Tournament team`', 'The Pre Draft tournament had a total of 64 teams and the East Coast Militia made it to the finals losing by just one goal. Three members of the Militia, one forward, one defenseman and a goalie were named to the prestige, all tournament team. Zach Luczyk, a forward headed to Quinnipiac University in fall of 2012, led the team in goals with four in four playoff games on Sunday. Coach Tasiopoulos had this to say about the three player''s performances, "First off, congratulations to the three young men on an incredible accomplishment. I have been playing and coaching summer hockey for quite a few years and never had a member of my organization be named all tournament. Zach Luczyk has been playing for me for many years now. He is a pure goal scorer no matter what level of play he competes at, he can really fire the puck. Quinnipiac is getting a great forward. Marc Hetnik played for me last summer and came back from the BCHL this year as a dominant defenseman. He was in my opinion the most solid defenseman in the entire tournament. Marc is one of the most highly sought after talents still on the market for a Division 1 scholarship and he will have some great teams to choose from after one more season up in the BCHL. Zac Rondeau was as solid in net this tournament as any coach could ask for. I was certain a few shots were going to be goals in the playoffs and Zac was able to keep the puck out of the net. He was the only goalie in the entire tournament of 64 teams selected to the all tournament team." A few other players to be noted; at forward, Chris Calnan and Joe Prescott played on a line together all weekend and really showed their Division 1 talents when given time and space. Steve Mckenna led the team in scoring in the round robin play and Andrew Neary on the blue line had a stellar performance all weekend, grabbing the attention of a lot of scouts. A great start for the Jr. Major team coming in 2nd out of 64 teams and we know the guys are eager to get back out there June 7th for the Hub Cup.', 'image_1.png', '2013-08-31 19:54:35'),

('U19 Lady Militia bring home the Gold in Lady Flames Summer Splash Tournament', 'This weekend marked the start of the East Coast Militia''s woman''s team. It was a raging success. The team went undefeated with a +19 goal differential in 5 games played.

The Lady Militia edged the Nor East Blizzard 4-3 in the finals.

The six members of the East Coast Militia that were drafted, (four forwards, one defenseman, and one goaltender), are all very special players and I am sure each team made their selections with no hesitation or doubt. I commend these players on their hard work on and off the ice and it is something special to see guys that you coach be recognized at the NHL level. I am extremely happy for our guys and wish them the best of luck." Congratulations to all the players and their families.', 'draft_picks.png', '2013-08-31 19:57:04'),
