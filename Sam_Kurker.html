Sam Kurker is a top player from Saint Johns Prep. He has been 
playing for Coach Tasiopoulos for 3 years now, and was committed 
to Boston University for 2013. Sam's great senior campaign led him 
to be ranked 35th on NHL central scouting final rankings amongst 
North American Skaters. "Sam's great size and ability to finish is what 
grabs scouts at the NHL's attention. Kurks has very high expectations for 
himself every shift and you can see the determination in his play no matter 
what level of competition he is playing at." said Coach Tasiopoulos. 
Head Coach of Boston University,Jack Parker, had a sit down meeting with 
Sam last week and said he would like him to skip his year of juniors in most 
likely the USHL and join the Terriers this fall. Congrats to Sam and his family.
