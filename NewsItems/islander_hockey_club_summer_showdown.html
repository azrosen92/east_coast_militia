The Jr. Major Militia came out to a slow start, dropping the first game to fall 0-1 in their bracket. They knew that had to respond with 2 victories Saturday to move on to playoff Sunday. Tommy Hartnett from Wesleyan came right in and sparked the offense. Ross Olsson, the Militia's top ranked MA, NHL Central Scouting A list forward, and Connor Gorman had great weekends, not to over shadow Billy Boudreau's game winning goal Short Handed in game 3. In the Playoffs the Militia had a tough road. Miami-Ohio's Jay Williams jumped in the net and played phenomenal. Carried by Jay, the Militia held off Hockey Essential 2-1. In the semi finals the boys faced CT Wings, who knocked out the South Shore Kings. Led by Miami-Ohio's Alex Gacek's 5 point game (3g 2a), the Militia popped 3 quick goals in the first 10 minutes and never looked back, winning handily 7-3. In the Championship game the Militia faced the Walpole Express who beat the Boston Jr. Bruins in their semi final game. The Militia came out flying and grabbed a 5-0 lead early. Jake Mcdonough and Mitch Barrington of Dexter had terrific games and Zac Rondeau was able to shut the door in net as the Militia skate to a 7-2 Championship Title. Great weekend boys.
