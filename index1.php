                      The 99 Militia played with a short bench all weekend and had to go through to best to win the title! The Militia beat ECS-Q, ECS-O, and Jr. Bruins. Militia entered the playoffs as a 4 seed with a 3-1 record. The 99's won the semi final game against the #1 seed ECS-O in a dramatic shoot out after a scoreless OT. Dominic Skrelja pulled off an amazing Pavel Datsyuk move in the shoot out after Brendan Bonello kicked aside all 3 break away attempts by highly skilled ECS-O forwards. The Militia then set out on revenge of their one loss in the tournament vs. the #2 seed and undefeated Jr. Bruins. After falling behind 1-0 early in a n abbreviated game, the 99's scored 3 unanswered and pulled off the upset to win the NAPS Beantown Tournament with just 9 players in the final game!

											Welcome to the website for the East Coast Militia, an elite organization 
											comprised of spring and summer tournament teams. We pride ourselves on 
											our players&apos; determination to relentlessly improve during the off&ndash;season 
											and on their desire to achieve every time they touch the ice. The oldest 
											Militia team &mdash; 1992 birth&ndash;years &mdash; is comprised of NHL draft picks and the Northeast&apos;s 
											very top prospects. The younger players within the Militia (as young as 1999 
											birth&ndash;years) are hard at work trying to emulate the success garnered by those 
											highly decorated prospects. One unique and irreproducible facet of joining the 
											Militia young is learning first&ndash;hand from successful mentors the traits that 
											transform average hockey players into bona&ndash;fide superstars. We realize that you 
											have a choice when deciding your summer hockey plans. Rest assured, this is an 
											opportunity unlike many others. First, decide how seriously you&apos;d like to take 
											your hockey career. If you&apos;re willing to sacrifice and be pushed beyond your 
											comfort level by elite teammates and coaches, then you&apos;re ready to join the 
											Militia in the battle to take your game to the next level. If you have any 
											questions or are ready to take up our challenge, please contact Nik at
