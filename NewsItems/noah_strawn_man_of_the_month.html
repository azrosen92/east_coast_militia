The East Coast Militia are proud to announce August'sBossi Watches Militia Man Of The Month. This month's winner is Noah Strawn. Noah has been a member of the Militia all summer and his loyalty to the organization has gone under the radar. Noah and his family have billeted players on numerous occasions, he refuses to put the jersey on for any other team if the Militia are in the tournament, and his leadership on the ice (12 points in the last two tournaments) have earned him Militia Man of the Month! Congrats Noah!
