The East Coast Militia are proud to announce the inaugural BOSSI Watches Militia Man of the Month Award! Our newest sponsor, BOSSI Watches, will assist in awarding the Militia who exemplifies hard work and determination in a battle to improve himself, along with their dedication to Militia Hockey. July's Militia Man of the Month is Zachary Luczyk. As a 1992 birth year, Zach Luczyk played in all four tournaments for the Jr. Major Militia. A lot of 92's do not normally participate in tournaments anymore but Zach wouldn't miss one for anything. In all four tournaments, Zach prided himself as one of the captains of the Jr. Major team and always gave everything he had. He was recognized in the 64 team, Pre Draft Tournament, as one of the top three forwards on the All-Tournament team. Zach plays with an edge that was contagious all summer to the rest of the players on the team. He played his heart out each shift and had a mouth full of blood at least once every tournament. Zach also finished his Militia career as the leading goal scorer for all ages with 17 goals in 4 tournaments. We would like to congratulate Zach on a great summer, thank him for his dedication to the Militia, and wish him luck next year at Quinnipiac University!</p>
