The 1996/1997 team got on the ice for the first time ever as members of the Militia. They showed great skill in game one outshooting the opponent Team Kanaly 37- 5 but the chemistry and team work was not there and we lost 3-1. The boys started out sluggish in game two going down 3-0 heading into the 3rd period. Coach Tasiopoulos commented on that 3rd period. "From that 3rd period on, the boys finally bought in and realized they can have all the skill in the world, but if they aren't willing to go to those hard nosed places like the corners and the front of the net then they are not going to be successful. I preached to them that 80% of goals at any level of hockey are scored right in front of the net, and the boys started throwing everything on net and following up shots for 2nd and 3rd chances." The Militia went on to win that game 6-3 and score 6, 6, 7, 6 goals for in their final 4 games of undefeated play. From the net out, the team matured quickly in 5 games and Coach Kanaly said "I have been doing these tournaments for years now and this is one of the best U-16 teams I have ever seen." Congrats to the U-16 Militia. The next 1997 tournament is The NH Championships, June 14th at Salem Icenter.
