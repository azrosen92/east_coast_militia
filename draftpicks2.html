Chris Calnan (2nd from left), is a 6'3 speedy forward who was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks 79th overall in the 3rd round. Chris, a Boston College recruit, did excellent at the NHL combine, coming in the top 10 in four different exercises. Charlestown, MA native, Matt Grzelcyk (2nd from right), was selected 85th overall in the 3rd round by the hometown Boston Bruins. Matt is a highly skilled defenseman who played for the National Development Program and is headed to Boston University this fall. Adam Gilmour (4th from left), was selected 98th overall early in the 4th round by the Minnesota Wild. Adam will be headed to the Muskegon Lumberjacks in the USHL before he skates for Boston College the following year. Danny O'Regan (1st on left), the 3rd member of the 6 draftees to be playing for Jack Parker at Boston University, rounded out the Militia members in the NHL Draft. Danny is an undersized forward at 5'9 who is highly skilled and was selected 138th overall in the 5th round by the San Jose Sharks. Coach Tasiopoulos had this to say after the draft, "There were actually 8 of our players on the NHL Central Scouting List, so I would first like to recognize Cam Darcy and Frank Vatrano, who are a pair of highly skilled forwards that played for the National Development Team and were not selected on Saturday's final day of the draft. The six members of the East Coast Militia that were drafted, (four forwards, one defenseman, and one goaltender), are all very special players and I am sure each team made their selections with no hesitation or doubt. I commend these players on their hard work on and off the ice and it is something special to see guys that you coach be recognized at the NHL level. I am extremely happy for our guys and wish them the best of luck." Congratulations to all the players and their families.
