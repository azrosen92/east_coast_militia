The Lady Militia went a perfect 4-0 as they had a bye to the championship game Sunday where they won 5-2. In Four games the girls only let in a total of 4 goals and put up 20 goals on offense! The team was made up of talented prep school girls ranging from 1994 birth year to 1997 birth year. Every girl that wore the camo this weekend contributed significantly to the tournament title and the Lady Militia look forward to their next tournament and some more hardware!
