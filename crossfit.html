						<p>Dynamic cross-fit training is the key to reaching 
						your next goal. Far too many hockey players go through 
						high school only concerned with bulking up. As a result, 
						they end up doing one dimensional, football-lineman-type 
						workouts. Cross-fit training is a combination of high tempo 
						strength work mixed with cardiovascular work to build endurance. 
						This amalgam of muscle building and coordination building 
						has become the predominant focus of trainers at both the professional
					 	and collegiate levels. Exercises that simulate playing the game &mdash; whether 
						that&apos;s stick handling, keeping your head up, working on peripheral 
						vision, or practicing your stride &mdash; which are an invaluable part of preparation 
						that, unfortunately, is often overlooked.</p> 
 
						<p>A combination of free weights, weighted vests, sled pulls, and bosu 
						ball balance-work are essential for high school players looking to improve. 
						Explosiveness &mdash; a function of the aforementioned recipe &mdash; is one of the most 
						important things in hockey; those first couple strides taken while accelerating 
						differentiate the good hockey players from the great ones. Additionally, we 
						have a synthetic ice sheet for working on shots with stick weights and weighted 
						pucks. We also lead stickhandling courses and engage our students in target 
						shooting competitions to instigate some friendly &mdash; and motivational &mdash; competition 
						between students in the session.</p>
 
						<p>Trainers all over New England are starting to offer this type of dynamic workout 
						perspective. Unfortunately, they&apos;ll also offer to drain your bank account. And! 
						for all that money, your son or daughter might not get the full attention they 
						require. These years are crucial in a child&apos;s hockey development. We understand 
						that entirely &mdash; and have committed ourselves to ensuring that the proper amount of 
						oversight is given to our students. Players committed to D1 schools are making 
						the trip to Norwell, MA to workout with The Militia to prepare themselves for 
						the next step in their hockey careers. Don't just be content with where you are, 
						test your body&apos;s limits, and fight to see how good you can become by training with 
						The Militia.</p>
