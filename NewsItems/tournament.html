The Pre Draft tournament had a total of 64 teams and the East Coast Militia made it to the finals losing by just one goal. Three members of the Militia, one forward, one defenseman and a goalie were named to the prestige, all tournament team. Zach Luczyk, a forward headed to Quinnipiac University in fall of 2012, led the team in goals with four in four playoff games on Sunday. Coach Tasiopoulos had this to say about the three player's performances, "First off, congratulations to the three young men on an incredible accomplishment. I have been playing and coaching summer hockey for quite a few years and never had a member of my organization be named all tournament. Zach Luczyk has been playing for me for many years now. He is a pure goal scorer no matter what level of play he competes at, he can really fire the puck. Quinnipiac is getting a great forward. Marc Hetnik played for me last summer and came back from the BCHL this year as a dominant defenseman. He was in my opinion the most solid defenseman in the entire tournament. Marc is one of the most highly sought after talents still on the market for a Division 1 scholarship and he will have some great teams to choose from after one more season up in the BCHL. Zac Rondeau was as solid in net this tournament as any coach could ask for. I was certain a few shots were going to be goals in the playoffs and Zac was able to keep the puck out of the net. He was the only goalie in the entire tournament of 64 teams selected to the all tournament team." A few other players to be noted; at forward, Chris Calnan and Joe Prescott played on a line together all weekend and really showed their Division 1 talents when given time and space. Steve Mckenna led the team in scoring in the round robin play and Andrew Neary on the blue line had a stellar performance all weekend, grabbing the attention of a lot of scouts. A great start for the Jr. Major team coming in 2nd out of 64 teams and we know the guys are eager to get back out there June 7th for the Hub Cup.
