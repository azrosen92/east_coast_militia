This weekend marked the start of the East Coast Militia's woman's team. 
It was a raging success. The team went undefeated with a +19 goal differential 
in 5 games played. Coach Tasiopoulos said "From top to bottom we had the most 
skilled team and that showed in some of our blow out games, but in the games that 
were close and the other team got physical with some of our younger girls, the team 
responded as a group every time and is a big reason we came out on top." The Lady Militia 
edged the Nor East Blizzard 4-3 in the finals. Harvard's Michelle Picard who plays for 
Team USA led the way for the girls and was complimented well by the Nobles trio 
Natasha Rachlin, Robyn White, Mallory Souliotis and the rest of the members of the 
Lady Militia. Congrats to the girls on a great start and championship well deserved!
